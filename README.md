# Image-Compression
Uses Fourier Transform on RGB images in order to reduce amount of information needed for storage.


Run Compression.m in order to see the image before and after compression. Which image is used can be changed by changing the string in line 7 to the file name of the desired image, as long as it is in the  same directory.
